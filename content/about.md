Polymaps is a team of young and talented Minecrafters who aim to set new standards for what is possible using the game Minecraft as a medium.

We create Minecraft maps. These are “worlds” that players can easily download and play. There are no mods involved, it is as simple as dragging and dropping a folder.

We offer many features within our custom maps. Examples of those features include custom textures and 3D models, custom sounds, voice acting, additional promotional graphics and everything you need to see your vision come to life within the game

## FAQ

* **What commissions do we accept?**  
  We accept commissions for custom Minecraft maps to be used as advertising for a product or brand. We also accept commissions for personal projects such as private maps for YouTubers. We do not currently accept commissions for Minecraft servers.
* **What benefits would a Minecraft map bring for our product/brand?**  
  Minecraft is one of the best ways to connect with a younger audience. With a Minecraft map you can combine advertising with the fun of the game itself to create an experience that doesn’t even feel like advertising, yet has the same effects. Virtual advertising within games is a fast growing market and delivers some of the best results for a cheaper price than traditional marketing.
* **How long does it take to complete a requested project?**  
  Depending on the scale, mechanics and detail of the project, you can expect it to be completed within 2-8 weeks from the initial starting date once through the planning and design stage.
* **How much does it cost to commission a project?**  
  Again this depends entirely on the scale, mechanics and detail of the project, but it is far cheaper than traditional advertising methods. If you wish to inquire about a price for a potential project, please contact us using the e-mail above.
* **Is it possible to request a project to be completed fast?**  
  We can do quick custom maps to meet specific deadlines, but only for smaller projects and for a considerably higher price.

If you have any other questions or queries, please do not hesitate to send us an e-mail us at [polymapsmc@gmail.com](mailto:polymapsmc@gmail.com) and we’d be more than happy to respond.
